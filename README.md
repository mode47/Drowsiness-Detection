# Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy. Various studies have suggested that around 20% of all road accidents are fatigue-related, up to 50% on certain roads. Some of the current systems learn driver patterns and can detect when a driver is becoming drowsy.
